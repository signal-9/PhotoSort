# PhotoSort
Bash script for sorting [PhotoRec](https://github.com/cgsecurity/testdisk) recovered data

[PhotoRec](https://github.com/cgsecurity/testdisk) sorts data in many directories, with no organization by filetype.  This script creates a new directory with subdirectories for every filetype recovered by [PhotoRec](https://github.com/cgsecurity/testdisk), then moves files into their corresponding place.
